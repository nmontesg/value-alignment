@description: A simple multi-agent model with two types of agents:
  - Individual: law-abiding citizens that always contribute to taxes if they can afford to.
  - Evaders: never contribute to taxes.
  Taxes are collected at every step, invested and redistributes. At every step, there is a probability that any evader
  is caught and fined.
Built with library mesa: https://mesa.readthedocs.io/en/master/index.html
